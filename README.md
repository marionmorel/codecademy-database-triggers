# Database Triggers

## Codecademy Project

We are running an online watch store and need to make sure we have a record of when customer information is modified and to ensure changes match our business rules. We will be looking at a small subset of this database server and examining two tables, customers and customers_log. The information in these tables were randomly generated.
